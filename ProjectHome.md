Due to the increase in computacional power in the last few years, there has been a significant growth in the market and complexity of eletronic games.Since games are real-time multimidia and interative systems, game development is an arduous and non-trivial task. Therefore, the use of frameworks and design patterns, encapsulating complexity, is crucial for the survival of any professional project.

The main goal of this work was to develop a game engine with features such as 3D graphics, physics simulation, collision detection, 3D sound and a simple, generic scripting API able to support the development of different kinds of 3D games. For this we used some Open Source libraries, including: Ogre3D, ODE,
OpenAL and Lua.
